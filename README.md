## Overview

I handled the frontend development for a branding agency, creating a website optimized for both desktop and mobile users. All elements were meticulously arranged to align with the design specifications provided in the reference images, ensuring a visually accurate and cohesive result. The website was built entirely from scratch using only HTML and CSS, without relying on any frameworks or libraries. This approach provided full control over the codebase, allowing for lightweight and highly customizable development tailored to the provided design.

## My process

I developed the website initially for the desktop version, ensuring all elements were correctly implemented and aligned with the design specifications. After finalizing the desktop layout and functionality, I adapted the website for mobile devices using CSS media queries. This approach allowed me to create a responsive design that maintained the integrity of the original layout while optimizing usability and aesthetics for smaller screens.
